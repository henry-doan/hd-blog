When you think of Dom you are probably think of Vin Diesel, Fast and Furious and family, but the D.O.M we are referring to is the **Document Object Model** 

> What makes up the web page of the styles, content and behavior.

It is also everything the user can see and can't see like all of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To create the D.O.M is just as simple as creating the HTML, CSS and JS files and the content is what makes up the D.O.M.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My App</h1>
    <p>This is my app</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1</li>
      <li>22</li>
      <li>333</li>
      <li>4444</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</html>
```

All of the content of the HTML including items in the head and body are all part of the D.O.M and we have HTML to define the structure and show items to the user. CSS to style and animate the D.O.M. Lastly the JavaScript is going to run logic and manipulate the D.O.M based off of the logic. This combined will create a functional web site for the user to see and interact with.

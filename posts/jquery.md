When we are working in programming languages we often times would use **Libraries**

> Predefined code that we can use in our projects.

Some languages may call it something else like packages, gems, etc. so it would be referenced on the language documentation. But there are also built in libraries that are included in the programming language or tool that you are using. There are also external packages you can use with CDN or with library managers.

One library we are going to go over is **JQuery**. It is a JavaScript library that allows to do some JavaScript shortcuts. So it would do the same logic like JavaScript but with less code with other syntax. This will allow you in web developement to manipulate the [DOM]() and allow you to change the structure, layout, and styles of your web page as well as run logic more efficiently. Here are a few examples of what JQuery can do:
- HTML / DOM manipulation
- CSS manipulation
- HTML event methods
- Effects and animations
- AJAX / Sending requests over a network
- Finding elements on a page
- Changing HTML content
- Listening for user interaction
- Animate content

For the next part, we are going to go over some examples of how to use JQuery and the syntax of what we can do with it.

In Object Oriented Programing, there are a lot of vocab that describes different things, and in most often of times, the words seem more intimidating even though they have simple definitions. 

One of those words is encapsulations and what it is:
> Bundling related data all in one place. 

That definition may be cryptic, but for me to explain what encapsulation is, I first have to expain what it is not.

What is not encapsulation is this:

And No this is not a NFT but am accepting offers, but what this is a blue print of a house and it is a very weird layout. With this layout there is a room for each item, so a room for eggs, a room for toast and different rooms for different things. So if you want to make a simple breakfast, you would have to go to the egg room to grab the eggs, the milk room to grab the milk, the pan room to grab the pan and you would finally be at the stove room to cook the first part of some scramble eggs. Then you would have to go to similar process to make pancakes and juice. Not only you would have to go to room to room, you are also spending way more time just to make breakfast. 

That's why houses aren't built like this. You don't have multiple rooms for different items. What you do have is this:

You have the **Kitchen**, that is what encapsulation is. You have all the cooking and food realted stuff all in one room/place and that is the kitchen in this case. So that way making a simple breakfast will be in a single room and is much more quicker than running to different rooms. Also, building a kichen is less work and money then an infinity amount of rooms for each item. 

When we are developing, we are doing the same thing as well, where we put everything having to do with the user in the user object. That makes our program more efficient, cleans up code, and puts everything related all in one place. There is multiple ways that we can do this in development, such as putting related functions, and data in a class, or even putting items into a folder. Encasulation is a powerful tool for development.

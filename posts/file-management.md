Imagine giving an alien directions to your house (they’re friendly aliens, no worries!), Where would you start? City, street, or something a little more broad?

Milky Way Galaxy -> directions to our solar system -> Planet Earth -> United States -> Navada -> Las Vegas -> 123 street.

Our computer systems are made up of files and folders and applications and pathways to keep organized and lead to the right place for our elements. Our computers have similar paths to tell them where to look for a folder or file or program, there’s a lot of data on each person’s computer:

Mac: /Users/username/desktop/my-projects/albums
Windows: C:\Users\Owner\Desktop\DPL\week5\todo_rails

That is why when we create programs we should put them in a project folder and within the project folder we would create more folders to house the project. You’ll want to start by making sure you are working inside the project folder that you are wanting to work in. If you are working on your About-Me project, then you would navigate to the about me project and anything having to do with the project goes in that folder. This way we don't have to reference a bunch or files in folder in other places, it is all encapsulated in the project folder. 

As for file names, your file name should be easy to remember, end in whatever language that file is going to be in (.css, .html, .js), and never contain any spaces or has numbers or symbols. Lastly be sure to follow the programming langauge best practice of how to name the file and how to do casing and connection of the name. 

Bad examples:
styles.html, javascript files.js, styles.styles

Good examples:
index.html, styles.css, main.js, home.html

Your file names should make sense of what the file is for and should be in the right folder it needs to be. 

With file and folder management, it really helps with keeping projects and programs organized of keeping everything related all in one place. Then when we need to reference them we can reference them from the path name to lead them to the right file or folder and would make our jobs as developers much easier.

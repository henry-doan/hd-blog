When you are developing, you are often times going to encounter some sort of terminal or command line. At first it may look very daunting and something from the matrix but it is a very power tool for development. Our computers are made up with a bunch of folders, files and programs, and we need to know how to manipulate them and other items on our machines. Often times when we say command line or terminal, we use them interchangeably because it is the same but one is on windows and the other is on mac and linux systems. 

Essentially, what the terminal is:
> Program to interact with your computer using commands.

How it works is that, there were some programers that created commands that then compiles to machine code to what ever machine it is in then finally compiles to binary of 1's and 0's for the computer to understand and run. That way instead of doing 1's and 0's we can just do a simple command to create a folder.
 
You might be thinking, isn't there different ways to do things beside the terminal? why even need a terminal? And you are correct, you can still create a folder by doing right click, then new folder. For basic and simple item you can do either way, but for more complex stuff such as creating file types or run a server are all easier to do in the terminal. Plus when in development, the terminal is a all in one tool that can aid you in the whole development stages and there are other tools such as Git, curl, vim, nano, and other cli tools that you can use in your project. In addition, if you are really good at it, you can do all the development in your terminal where you can do everything all in one place where as to use different programs to achieve the same goal.

All terminal have items that are the same across the board, regardless of operating systems. Lets go over some of them. 

- **Prompt**, this is the start of the command line and is often times a program window.
- **Cursor**, where you can input the commands.
- **User**, The login operator, there are some terminals and program that will give certain permission based off of users. 
- **Commands**. Words, or shorcuts that run certain operations on the machine.
- **CLI** Command Line Interface, is connected to the prompt to have access to the machine.
- **Directory**, Folders
- **File Extension**, Identifier for what type of file it is.
- **Application**, A Software program for certain tasks.

There are also Terminal Emulators as well which are: 
> A program that simulates your terminal but with more added features.
These are good for having a more personable terminal or adding some styles and other tools to make your terminal process more efficient. 

Hopefully this post made the terminal less intimating, and got you curious of using it. The terminal is a fast, efficient tool that pair with any kind of development and you will definently encounter a few during your career in the industry. The main thing to know is what is it? and how to use it? We will later touch on other post about different commands in a mac environment.

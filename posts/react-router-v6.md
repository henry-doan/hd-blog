You probably heard of the term 

>"If it ain't broke, don't fix it". 

That holds true to developers, and the more seasoned they are, the more they tend to only use what they are comfortable with and has been working for them. 

React Router has been used in many ReactJS applications to help with routing and navigation between components to have the ability to go to pages in web development. Recently, their patterns have changed and the old way is causing errors inside new projects and would need to do the new way for it to work like intended. Granted, if you have old projects that are lower than version 6 or want to use a older version, than it will still work like normal, just updating the package or using the newer package would follow these changes.

For more details and their documentation, you can find that here [https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6). I am just going to outline the main changes below.

if you want to implement the new version you would have to install it in your project using your prefered package manager. We will be using yarn but you can also run the command in npm as well.

To install the new version in your a ReactJS project you would run a in the terminal:

```console
yarn add react-router-dom@6
```

or with npm:

```console
npm install react-router-dom@6
```

This will install the version 6 of React Router Dom but if you exclude the *@6* it would grab the latest and greatest version but in this case we are focusing on version 6.


 
In conclusion, change is inevitable, especially in the tech industry where more advances happens on the daily. The main thing for us to do be continual learners to adapt to the changes so we don't be left behind and still relevant in today's world.
